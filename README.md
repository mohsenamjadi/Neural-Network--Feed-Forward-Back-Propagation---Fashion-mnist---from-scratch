# Neural-Network--Feed-Forward-Back-Propagation---Fashion-mnist---from-scratch

This is an implementation of feed forward and back propagation neural networks with python 	from scratch , just using numpy. For that Iâ€™ve used Fashion MNIST dataset  that consists of 60000 images and we are trying to classify clothes from 0 to 9 labels.
